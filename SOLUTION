SOLUTION
Start system.
Wait for feeding time.
If feeding time = time in clock  → check container food level.
If food available in container → rotate motor to drop portion.
Wait 10 minutes.
Check if bowl weight decreased means the pet ate the food.
If yes → return to idle and do nothing . If no → send message
If container empty → send message immediately.
