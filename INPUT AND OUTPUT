Inputs/Outputs-
Inputs: feeding time plan, sensors (to check bowl weight and food level).
Outputs: motor drops the food, alert message is sent (buzzer/text/display)
Sample values: The feeder is set to give food at set times, for example 8:00 AM, 12:30 PM, and 7:00 PM, with about 100 grams each time (can be between 60â€“110 g). The bowl can hold up to 450 g, while the main container can store up to 1.8 kg of food. A warning is sent if the food left in the container is below 20% or if the pet eats less than 25 g within 30 minutes after feeding. The motor runs for around 5 seconds to drop the food, and sensors check the bowl and container every 15 seconds once the food is dispensed. The buzzer rings for 4 seconds and a message is also sent right away if needed.
